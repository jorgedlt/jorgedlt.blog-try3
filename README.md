### Experimenting with jekyll -- update 10 AUG 2016 10:30/est

The current files are completly generic and 100% built by jekyll, and my github builds seem to fail. My local test with 'bundle exec jekyll serve' work perfectly.

but I alternate between ...

	The page build failed with the following error:
	
	A file was included in `about.md` that is a symlink or does not exist in your `_includes` directory. 
	For more information, see https://help.github.com/articles/page-build-failed-file-is-a-symlink.
	
	For information on troubleshooting Jekyll see:
	
	  https://help.github.com/articles/troubleshooting-jekyll-builds
	
	If you have any questions you can contact us by replying to this email.

and ...

	The page build failed with the following error:
	
	Your SCSS file `css/main.scss` has an error on line 36: File to import not found or unreadable: minima. For more information, see https://help.github.com/articles/page-build-failed-invalid-sass-or-scss.
	
I have a ticket opened with github, and they are providing some guideance, this is suppoese to be a learning excercise so there is point in stressing about it.
